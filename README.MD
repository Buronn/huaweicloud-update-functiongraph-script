## Preparation

1. **Create `function` directory:**

    Create a directory called `function` on your machine. This is where you should place your function code.

    ```bash
    mkdir -p /app/function
    ```

2. **Place function code:**

    Your function code should reside within the `/app/function` directory. It will be zipped and uploaded as part of the deployment process.

## How to Use

### Option 1: Run with Docker Compose üê≥

1. Make sure you have Docker Compose installed.
2. Modify the `docker-compose.yml` and `example.env` files to suit your requirements.
3. Run the script with Docker Compose:

   ```bash
   docker-compose up
   ```

### Option 2: Run the script manually üß∞üî®

1. **Download the script:**

   Use `curl` or `wget` to download the raw script:

   ```bash
   curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Buronn/huaweicloud-update-functiongraph-script/main/entrypoint.sh
   ```
   Or
   ```bash
   wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Buronn/huaweicloud-update-functiongraph-script/main/entrypoint.sh
   ```

2. **Make the script executable:**

   ```bash
   chmod +x entrypoint.sh
   ```

3. **Set environment variables:**

   You can either export them in your shell session or put them in a `.env` file.

   ```bash
   export FUNC_NAME="my_function"
   export REGION="cn-north-4"
   export PROJECT_ID="your_project_id"
   # ... (set all required variables)
   ```

   Or, in a `.env` file:

   ```env
   FUNC_NAME=my_function
   REGION=cn-north-4
   PROJECT_ID=your_project_id
   # ... (set all required variables)
   ```

   If you use a `.env` file, make sure to source it:

   ```bash
   source .env
   ```

4. **Run the script:**

   ```bash
   ./entrypoint.sh
   ```
## Troubleshooting

- Make sure you have all required CLI tools installed (`koocli`, `jq`, `expect`, `zip`).
- If using Docker Compose, ensure that Docker Compose is installed.
- Ensure all environment variables are set before running the script.
- Check the log messages carefully to diagnose any issues.
